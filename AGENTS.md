- Always check npx tsc --noEmit and build errors and fix all after code modification or file created.

- never use `className` which doesn't exist in React Native (only works with NativeWind)

- Never run dev server, we have already running in another terminal.

- if same error repeat twice after implementing the fix once, then do specific web search and find the solution.
